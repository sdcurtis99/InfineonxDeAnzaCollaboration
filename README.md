# InfineonxDeAnzaCollaboration
Project Collaboration between De Anza Students and Infineon Technologies to develop embedded ai models on PSOC 6 AI chips.
Overview

This project utilizes the Infineon PSoC 6 AI chip to implement an advanced fall detection system using Infineon's ready-to-deploy MTBML model. The system leverages machine learning to detect falls in real-time, making it suitable for applications in healthcare, elderly care, and safety monitoring.

    Features

PSoC 6 AI Chip: A low-power, high-performance microcontroller with AI capabilities.

Fall Detection Model: A pre-trained machine learning model optimized for detecting falls.

MTBML (ModusToolbox Machine Learning): Infineon's ready-to-deploy ML framework for embedded applications.

Real-time Processing: Continuous motion data analysis using an accelerometer (BMI270).

Low-Power Operation: Designed for battery-efficient operation in wearable and IoT devices.

    Hardware Requirements

Infineon PSoC 6 AI Development Board

BMI270 Accelerometer (for motion tracking)

ModusToolbox Development Environment

Infineon MTBML Package

    Installation & Setup

  1. Set Up ModusToolbox

Download and install ModusToolbox from Infineon. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed.

  2. Clone the Project Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/psoc6-fall-detection.git
cd psoc6-fall-detection

    3. Import the MTBML Model

Locate and install the MTBML fall detection model within ModusToolbox.

Configure the model parameters to align with your use case.

    4. Build & Deploy Using ModusToolbox

Open ModusToolbox and import the project.

Use kit3proj to configure and build the model.

Deploy the compiled application to the PSoC 6 AI chip using the built-in flashing tools.

    Usage

Data Collection: The accelerometer continuously captures motion data.

ML Inference: The MTBML model processes the data to detect fall patterns.

Alert System: When a fall is detected, an alert is triggered (e.g., LED indication or wireless notification).

    Customization

Tweak Model Parameters: Modify model thresholds for different environments.

Expand Functionality: Integrate additional sensors or cloud connectivity.

Optimize Power Consumption: Adjust processing frequency for battery efficiency.
